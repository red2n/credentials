# CORS Issue Resolved - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed ✅

The CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue has been resolved. The problem was that the Angular frontend (running on port 4200) was making requests to the API server (running on port 3000), which requires CORS configuration.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added CORS Plugin
```bash
npm install @fastify/cors
```

### 2. Updated API Server Configuration
Added CORS middleware to `/home/subramani/credentials/apps/api/src/index.ts`:

```typescript
// Register CORS plugin to allow requests from the Angular frontend
server.register(import('@fastify/cors'), {
  origin: [
    'http://localhost:4200',  // Angular development server
    'http://127.0.0.1:4200',  // Alternative localhost
    'http://localhost:3000',  // Same origin
    'http://127.0.0.1:3000'   // Alternative same origin
  ],
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', 'Accept'],
  credentials: true
});
```

## Test Results ✅

### CORS Preflight Request
```bash
curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:4200" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Content-Type"
```

**Response**: `204 No Content` with proper CORS headers:
- `access-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:4200`
- `access-control-allow-credentials: true`
- `access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS`
- `access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, Authorization, Accept`

### Actual API Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Origin: http://localhost:4200" \
  -d '{"username":"demo123","password":"demo123"}'
```

**Response**: Successful authentication with CORS headers included.

## Test User Created
For testing purposes, a demo user has been created:
- **Username**: `demo123`
- **Password**: `demo123`
- **Email**: `demo@example.com`

## How to Test the UI

1. **Open the application**: http://localhost:4200
2. **Go to Login page**: Should be the default route
3. **Try logging in** with the demo credentials:
   - Username: `demo123`
   - Password: `demo123`
4. **Test registration** by going to `/register`:
   - Try different usernames to see real-time validation
   - Watch the Bloom filter validation in action

## Username Validation Testing

### Available Username
Try typing: `newuser123`
- Should show green checkmark with "Username is available"

### Existing Username
Try typing: `demo123`
- Should show red X with "Username is already taken"

## Current Status
- ✅ **API Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000 with CORS enabled
- ✅ **Angular UI**: Running on http://localhost:4200
- ✅ **Cross-origin requests**: Working properly
- ✅ **Username validation**: Bloom filter + database check working
- ✅ **User registration**: Creating new users successfully
- ✅ **User authentication**: Login functionality working
- ✅ **Real-time validation**: UI showing immediate feedback

## Next Steps
The application is now fully functional! You can:
1. Test the complete registration flow with real-time username validation
2. Test the login functionality with actual API authentication
3. Explore the username validation using the Bloom filter mechanism
4. Run k6 load tests to verify performance under load

The CORS issue is completely resolved and all cross-origin requests from the Angular frontend to the API backend are now working correctly.
